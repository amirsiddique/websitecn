            I am a kitchen and bedroom designer by profession, and I have been working as a kitchen and bedroom designs since 2006. I was thinking about a career change since last few month and this is how I came to Code Nation. It is a new experience for me as I
            have not done any code before and finding it very challenging.

            Technology has important effects on business operations. No matter the size of your enterprise, technology has both tangible and intangible benefits that will help you make money and produce the results your customers demand. Technological infrastructure
            affects the culture, efficiency and relationships of a business. It also affects the security of confidential information and trade advantages.

                Discovery: This is the idea-generating stage, where new concepts are explored, and solutions are identified.
            </li>
            <li>
                Planning: Create a wireframe to determine the project’s scope.
            </li>
            <li>
                Production: Move onto beta testing the product and working on front-end coding.

            </li>
            <li>
                Deployment: How is your product performing once it’s gone live? Make evaluations and fixes based on those observations and tests.
            </li>
            <li>
                Maintenance: The project doesn’t have a hard ending but remains open for support throughout its life.

            Schedule risk. the risk that activities will take longer than expected. Slippages in schedule typically increase costs and, also, delay the receipt of project benefits, with a possible loss of competitive advantage.

        <h4>Performance risk.</h4>
        <p>The risk that the project will fail to produce results consistent with project specifications.</p>
        <h4>Governance risk. </h4>
        <p>Relates to board and management performance with regard to ethics, community stewardship, and company reputation.</p>
        <h4>Strategic risks. </h4>
        <p>Result from errors in strategy, such as choosing a technology that can’t be made to work.</p>
        <h4>Operational risk.</h4>
        <p>Includes risks from poor implementation and process problems such as procurement, production, and distribution.</p>
        <h4>Market risks.</h4>
        <p>Include competition, foreign exchange, commodity markets, and interest rate risk, as well as liquidity and credit risks.</p>
        <h4>Legal risks.</h4>
        <p>Arise from legal and regulatory obligations, including contract risks and litigation brought against the organization.</p>
        <h4>Risks associated with external hazards</h4>

        <P>
            To improve the productivity I will use Trello which helps a lot to manage the team and imrove the work efficiency. It is more easy for the project manager to assign the role and monitoring the progress of the project.
        </P>
        <p>Slack is also very useful tool so the team members can share the work, which helps to manage the project more effeciently. Using Slack calls (voice and video) plus screen sharing to connect with anyone in your workspace. Creating a common area
            between two unique workspaces so you can find everything you need in one place.

        <p>The way to provide high-quality software is to implement effective QA management that provides tools and methodologies for building bug-free products. Software quality management is an umbrella term covering three core aspects: quality assurance,
            quality control, and testing.
        </p>
        <p>
            Software quality assurance (SQA) is the part of quality management that includes a planned set of organizational actions. The purpose of these actions is to improve the software development process, introducing standards of quality for preventing errors
            and bugs in the product.
        </p>
        <p>
            Software quality control (SQC) is the part of quality management that includes a set of activities focused on fulfilling quality requirements. QC is about product-oriented activities that certify software products for their quality before release. The
            process of software quality control is governed by software quality assurance.
        </p>
        <p>
            Testing is the basic activity aimed at detecting and solving technical issues in the software source code and assessing the overall product usability, performance, security, and compatibility. It isn’t only the main part of quality assurance; it is also
            an integral part of the software development process.
